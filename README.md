# Sodoku-Solver
This program uses backtracking to solve the sudoku puzzle by checking multiple times if numbers are in valid positions and placing them and also removing them if they do not meet the sudoku requiments. This is done by checking the row, column, and box requirments (no repeated numbers in any of these) multiple times as numbers are added by the program.
